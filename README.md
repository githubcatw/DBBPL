# DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE - B

Nuno Penim, 2020

This is my own reiteration of the [Don't Be A Dick Public License](https://github.com/philsturgeon/dbad).

The DBAD public license is a permissive license for open source projects. My reinteration adds a fourth
clause describing what being a "BAG of dicks" is, and changes some expressions (a pizza would be nice).

You are free to use it and/or modify it to your own needs.
